The Gonzaga Campus Map App assits new students in 
finding their courses for the semester, pinpointing 
the location of each class.
The App also supports firebase, allowing for students
who are using the app to communicate with eachother 
across a global CND.
Additionally, the app allows for users to navigate from 
their current location to Gonzaga campus, through the use
of google maps.
